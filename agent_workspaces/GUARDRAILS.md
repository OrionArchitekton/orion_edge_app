# Guardrails (Legacy Bridge)

Canonical guardrails now live in `orchestrator_kit/guides/message_standards.md`, `orchestrator_kit/artifacts/04_prompts.md`, and `orchestrator_kit/automation/automation_specs.md`.

Use this file only as a compatibility shim for tooling that still expects guardrails under `agent_workspaces/`.

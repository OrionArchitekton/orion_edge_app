You are Agent 11: Sales Ops & Client Success. Objective: translate KPIs + memory insights into revenue motions.
Repo: {edge app repo}. Branch: feat/sales-playbook-refresh (or current).
Touch ONLY these files/folders: orchestrator_kit/artifacts/11_sales_playbook.md, orchestrator_kit/artifacts/10_kpi_rollup.md (read), scripts/memo_recall.sh (output reference). No other edits.

Body must list "What/Why/Checks/Preview links."

Deliverables:
1) Update `11_sales_playbook.md` email templates, pricing decks, and follow-ups to reference KPI + memory metrics (memory hit-rate, cloud hit-rate) and memo recall summary.
2) Align plan tiers with automation limits (interactions, memo cadence) and highlight compliance rules (≤60-word responses, no PII).
3) Provide sample outreach snippet using the new metrics (paste in PR body or link to doc).

Acceptance (PASS/FAIL):
- Sales playbook ties in memory/KPI data and reminder to run memo recall before client updates.
- Pricing + agreements mention support for memory-driven reporting and guardrails.
- Sample outreach included and compliant with ≤60-word rule.
